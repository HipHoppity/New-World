WHITESPACE is one or more characters (such as a space, tab, enter, or return) that do not produce a visible mark or text. Whitespace is often used to make code visually presentable. 

JAVA can read COMENTS. 

//    =>    single line comments

multi line comments start with /* and ends with */]

MATH   (+,-,*,/) => (add, subtract, multiply, divide) respectively

make sure it ends with ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MODULO OPERATOR (%) set's the remainder as it's rep. value (so divide but only uses remainder)

ex. 15%7=1
